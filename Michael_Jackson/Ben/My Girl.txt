When it's cold outside, I've got the month of May
Well, I guess you'll say
What can make me feel this way?
My girl (My girl)
Talkin' 'bout my girl (Talkin' 'bout my girl)

I've got so much honey the bees envy me
I've got a sweeter song, yeah, than the birds in the trees
Well, I guess you'll say
What can make me feel this way?
My girl (My girl, my girl)
Talkin' 'bout my girl (Talkin' 'bout my girl)

Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey
Ooh

I don't need no money, yeah, fortune, or fame
I've got all the riches, baby, one man can claim (That one man can claim)
Well, I guess you'll say
What can make me feel this way?
My girl (My girl, my girl)
Talkin' 'bout my girl (Talkin' 'bout my girl)

I've got sunshine on a cloudy day
With my girl
I've even got the month of May
With my girl
Talkin' 'bout my girl
Ooh, yeah, my girl
Ooh, my girlYou might also like1Embed
