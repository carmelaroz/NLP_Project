Maybe you and I can't do great things
We may not change the world in one day
But we still can change some things today
In our small way

Empty words are not enough
Where there's hurt, we'll be a crutch
When there's thirst, we'll fill each other's cup
Because we care, we love
Enough to share (Enough to share)

Maybe you and I can't do great things (Do great things)
We may not change the world in one day
But we still can change some things today (Today)
In our small way

In despair, we'll be the hope (Be the hope)
And the prayer that frees the soul (Frees the soul)
We'll be there to share each lonely road (Lonely road)
Because we love, I know (I know)
We care enough, yeah (We care enough)
Maybe you and I can't do great things (Do great things)
We may not change the world in one day
But we still can change some things today (Today)
In our small way

Just a little time is all it takes (Just a little time is all it takes)
What a difference just a smile can make, you'll see (We've got)
Love is all we need (We've got love, yeah)

Maybe you and I can't do great things
We may not change the world in one day
(But we still) But we still can change some things today
In our small way
