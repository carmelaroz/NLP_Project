The world is the biggest school
As you live, you learn, though a torch will burn
Everybody's somebody's fool (Everybody's somebody's fool)

You go through life making fools of others
Pretending you're giving them love
But remember, sister or brother
You all have to answer to the one up above (To the one up above)

It's beautiful to watch love begin
But, oh, so sad when it ends (So sad when it ends)
As you go through life, remember this rule
Everybody's somebody's fool (Everybody's somebody's fool)

Oh, it's beautiful to watch love begin
But, oh, so sad when it ends (So sad when it ends)
As you go through life, remember this rule
Everybody's somebody's fool (Everybody's somebody's fool)You might also like2Embed
