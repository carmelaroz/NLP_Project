Love is like a circus
And a carnival is beautiful to see
Love can turn your mind around
Like Ferris wheels and spinning carousels

[Pre-Chorus]
You'll be a part of the world of make believe
Flying high like a man on a trapeze

Oh, everyday's a holiday
Get your tickets right away
Love, love, love
It's the greatest show on Earth

The fantasy you see is like
A child again through rainbow-colored eyes
Step right up, it's circus time
And get your money’s worth of love today

[Pre-Chorus]
You'll be a part of the world of make believe
Flying high like a man on a trapeze
Everyday's a holiday
Get your tickets right away
Love, love, yeah
It's the greatest show on Earth

Everyday's a holiday
Get your tickets right away
Love, love, love
It's the greatest show on Earth

Love, love, love
It's the greatest show on earth (Yeah, yeah)
Love, love, yeah
It's the greatest show on earth
Love, love, yeah4Embed
