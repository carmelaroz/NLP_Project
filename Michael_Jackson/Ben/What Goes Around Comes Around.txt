(What goes around, yeah
Comes around, yeah)

I've had my eyes on you
For three long years
When no one else wanted you
I took you in and held you near
But then, you drifted away (Drifted away)
After you said you'd always stay (Always stay)
How could you be so mean and untrue?
He didn't want you until he'd seen
What my love did for you, yeah (Did for you)

Ooh, baby, what goes around comes around
I knew he'd soon be gone
Yeah, baby, he put you down, now, you're the clown
And you want me to come back home
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)

I've had no love affairs
For three long years (Three long years)
Remember how I used to care
When you were down, I dried your tears (Dried your tears)
Who did you think was the fool?
I let you treat me so cruel
This is the moment of truth for you
Do you think your playing is through?
I don't think I can trust you
Ooh, baby, what goes around comes around
I knew he'd soon be gone
Yeah, baby, he put you down, now, you're the clown
And you want me to come back home?
Yeah, yeah, yeah
What goes around comes around
He put you down, now, you're the clown
(Goes around, yeah
Comes around, yeah)

(I've had my eyes on you
For three long years
When no one else wanted you
I took you in and held you near, yeah)

Yeah, yeah, baby, what goes around comes around
I knew he'd soon be gone
Now, now, baby, he put you down, now, you're the clown
And you want me to come back home?
Yeah, yeah, yeah

What goes around comes around
He put you down, now, you're the clown (Clown, ooh)
(Don't you know, don't you know, don't you know, don't you know)
Yeah, yeah, baby, what goes around comes around
He put you down, now, you're the clown, yeah (Clown, ooh)
(Don't you know, don't you know, don't you know, don't you know)
Na-na-na-na-na-na, baby, what goes around comes around1Embed
