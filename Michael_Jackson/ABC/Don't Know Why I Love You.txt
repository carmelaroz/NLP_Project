Oh, sho'nuff baby, baby, baby... ooh, ooh

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't know why I love you
I don't know why I love you
I don't know why I love you but I love you

Always treat me like a fool
Kick me when I'm down that's your rule
I don't know why I love you, but I love you
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Oh you'll never, you'll never stop your cheatin' ways
With another guy you laughed in my face
Lord how long must I be disgraced
'Cause I love you, oh, baby, baby, baby

I don't know why I love you
I don't know you and me, baby, oh yeah
I don't know why I love you, but I love you, baby
Oh darling, darling, darling, darling ...
You throw my heart down in the dirt
Oh, you make me crawl
On this cold black earth, baby yeah
I never knew, I never knew how much I could hurt
'Til I love you baby, baby, baby, baby, yeah

Can't stop, I can't stop crying can't you see
Here I'm pleadin' on my knees
Upon my knees, yeah baby, yeah
Won't you help me, help me please
'Cause I love you, love you, love you, ohh
(Sho'nuff, baby)

I don't know, we don't know, we don't know nothing about it
(I don't know why I love you... Oh! Oh!)
I don't know why I love you baby, baby
(I don't know, I don't know)
I don't know why I love you baby, baby... don't know why thoughEmbed
