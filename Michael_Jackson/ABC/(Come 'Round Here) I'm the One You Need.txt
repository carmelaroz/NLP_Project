Now you say every time you need some affection
The one you love goes in another direction
You just sit back in a daze, reminiscing
'Cause you know some other lips he's been kissing

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Now when you need the love he'll never show you
Come around here
And when you need some loving arms to hold you
Come around here

Now, I may not be the one you want
(Honey, honey)
But I know I'm the one you need
(Honey, honey)
Say now, I may not be the one you want
(Honey, honey)
But I know I'm the one you need
(Honey, honey)

[Interlude]
Your life stands still
The minute he goes
You count the hours
Just hoping he shows
Girl, can't you see while you're longing for his touch
(Honey, honey)
That I'm the one who loves you so much
(Honey, honey)
And while you're longing for his embrace
(Honey, honey)
You're all lonely with the tears on your face
(Honey, honey)

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Now when you feel the need to cry to someone
Cry to me
And when you feel the need to lean on someone
Lean on me

Now, I may not be the one you want
(Honey, honey)
Oh, but I'm sure 'nough the one you need
(Honey, honey)
Oh, I may not be the one you want
(Honey, honey)
But I'm sure 'nough the one you need
(Honey, honey)
Now the days, the days, the days you sit alone by yourself
He's out fooling around with somebody else
Leaving you alone here with nothing to do
He's just waiting 'til he has time for you

[Pre-Chorus 3]
Now, when the loneliness get hard to bear, girl
Come around here
And when you need a little tender love and care, girl
Come around here

Now, I may not be the one you want
(Honey, honey)
Ooh, but I'm sure 'nough the one you need
(Honey, honey)
Oh yeah, I may not be the one you want
(Honey, honey)
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby!
(Honey, honey)

I may not be the one you want
(Honey, honey)
But, I'm sure 'nough the one you need...Embed
