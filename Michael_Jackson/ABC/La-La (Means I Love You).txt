Many guys have come to you
With a line that wasn't true
And you passed them by
Are you in the center ring
And their lines don't mean a thing
Why don't you let me try
Now, I don't wear a diamond ring
I don't even know a song to sing..

All I know is la-la la-la la-la la-la la means, I love you
Oh, baby, please, now
La-la la-la la-la la-la la means, I love you

If I ever saw a girl
That I needed in this world
You are the one for me
Let me hold you in my arms
Girl, and thrill you with my charms
I'm sure you will see
The things I am sayin' are true
Listen to me...

The things I am sayin' are true
And the way I explain them to you
Yes, to you Listen to me
