Into each life, some rain falls
Then comes the snow
But after the snow
The flowers will grow
Girl, when my life got stormy
You stayed for the ride
You stayed by my side
You make the sun shine

I'm up again, I never let you down
Nothing's ever gonna stop me now
Up again, I never let you down
I love you

This Humpty Dumpty's lucky
He's had his fall
But after it all
He brushed himself off
Knowing how much you loved me
I made one more try
I reached for the sky
And I made it this time
I'm up again, I never let you down
Nothing's ever gonna stop me now
Up again, I never let you down
I love you

[Instrumental Break]

I'm up again, I never let you down, oh-oh
Nothing's ever gonna stop me now
Up again, I never let you down
I love you
Up again, I never let you down
Nothing's ever gonna stop me now
Up again, I never let you down
I love you
Up again, I never let you down, no, no, no
Nothing's ever gonna stop me now
Up again, I never let you down
I love you, yeah
Never let you down, baby
Nothing's ever gonna stop me now, yeahEmbed
