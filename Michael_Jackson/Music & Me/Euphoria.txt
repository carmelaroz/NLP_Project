Love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love
Euphoria, euphoria
Euphoria, euphoria

E-U-P-H-O-R-I-A
That's the new word for today
E-U-P-H-O-R-I-A
It is very easy to say

[Pre-Chorus]
Say euphoria
And you'll feel fine from the start
You can close your eyes
And see the world with your heart

Do what you wish, be what you are
What a victorious thrill
Wearing a smile, all of the while
Feeling the world standing still
Watch rainbows glow
Rest on a bed of flowers
Then dial a star
Anything's in your powers

E-U-P-H-O-R-I-A
Full of [?]
Knowing no ills, needing no pills
Singing a rock and roll hymn

[Pre-Chorus]
Feeling glorious, full of love
Fine from the start
You can close your eyes
And see the world with your heart

How good to be happy and free
Living the way that you choose
Healthy and clean
Can't understand anyone having the blues

Euphoria
Never to feel frustration
How great to give
Love without limitation
Euphoria, euphoria
Long as we love each other
Euphoria, euphoria
Living for one another
Euphoria, euphoria
That's the new word for heaven
Euphoria, euphoria
Living in love is heaven
Euphoria, euphoria
Long as we love each other
Euphoria, euphoriaEmbed
