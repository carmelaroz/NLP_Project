Morning glow, morning glow
Starts to glimmer when you know
Winds of change are set to blow
And sweep this whole land through
Morning glow is long past due
Morning glow, fill the earth
Come and shine for all you're worth
We'll be present at your birth
Of all things looking new
Morning glow is long past due

Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh (Morning glow)
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
I'd like to help you grow
You should have started long ago

Morning glow all day long (Morning glow)
While we sing tomorrow's song (Morning glow)
Never knew we could be so strong
But now, it's very clear
Morning glow, it's almost here

Oh-oh-oh (Morning glow)
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
I'd like to help you grow
We should have started long ago
Morning glow, filled with light
You can make the whole day bright
All the bad songs of the night
Will fade into the past
Morning glow is here at last
Woo-oooh, wooh-oooh, woo-oooh, woo-ooohEmbed
