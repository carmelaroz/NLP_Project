(He's born to be wild)

Free and untamed
That's how I've grown
(He's Johnny Raven)
Settling down ain't my nature
Roots I'll never own
(He's Johnny Raven)

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, your smile
But tell me, ain't your child
How can you cage a bird
Born to be wild
(Born to be wild)

I'm Johnny Raven
(He's Johnny Raven)
By and by
(By and by)
Oh, I'm gonna leave your nest, girl
Another nest to try
Ooh, Johnny Raven (Oh, Johnny Raven)
Girl, you know I shouldn't have loved you
Yeah, but I've got to leave you
When my restless heart says fly
Look at you, little girl
You feel love so deep, yeah, yeah
(He's Johnny Raven)
If I could change in a second
I'd change for you like that
Stay right here for keeps
(He's Johnny Raven)

[Pre-Chorus]
But I'm hungry for new thrills
Stray, I will
Seems I gotta need one girl
Never can feel

Yeah, I'm Johnny Raven
(He's Johnny Raven)
By and by
(By and by)
Oh, I'm gonna leave your nest
Another nest to try
Ooh, Johnny Raven (Oh, Johnny Raven)
Girl, you know I shouldn't have loved you
Yeah, but I've got to leave you
When my restless heart says goodbye
Everybody knows my name
I'm Johnny Raven
(He's Johnny Raven)
Yeah, yeah, by and by
(He's Johnny Raven)
Ooh, I'm gonna fly and when you cry
(Johnny, Johnny, Johnny)
Part of me is gonna die
(He's Johnny Raven)
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)

Ooh, I'm Johnny Raven
(Johnny, Johnny, Johnny)
Yeah, yeah, by and by
(He's Johnny Raven)
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Ooh, I'm gonna fly and when you cry, yeah
(Johnny, Johnny, Johnny)
Part of me is gonna die
(He's Johnny Raven)
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)

(Johnny, Johnny, Johnny)
(He's Johnny Raven)
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
(Johnny, Johnny, Johnny)
(He's Johnny Raven)
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
(Johnny, Johnny, Johnny)
(He's Johnny Raven)
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
(Johnny, Johnny, Johnny)Embed
