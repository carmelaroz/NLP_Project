You are the promised kiss of springtime
That makes the lonely winter seem long
You are the breathless hush of evening
That trembles on the brink of a lovely song
You are the angel glow that lights a star
The dearest things I know are what you are

Someday, my happy arms will hold you
And someday, I'll know that moment divine
When all the things you are, are mine

You are the angel glow that lights a star
The dearest things I know are what you are

Some, some, some, someday
My happy arms will hold you
And someday, I'll know that moment divine
When all the things you are, are mine
Yeah, yeah, all the things you are, are mine
All the things you are gon' be mine
Someday you are, are mine
All the things you are gon' be mine
All the things you are gon' be mineYou might also likeEmbed
