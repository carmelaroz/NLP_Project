We've been together for such a long time
Now, music, music and me
Don't care whether all our songs rhyme
Now, music, music and me

Only know wherever I go
We're as close as two friends can be
There have been others
But never two lovers
Like music, music and me

Grab a song and come along
You can sing your melody
In your mind, you will find
A world of sweet harmony

Birds of a feather, we'll fly together
Now, music, music and me
Music and meYou might also like1Embed
