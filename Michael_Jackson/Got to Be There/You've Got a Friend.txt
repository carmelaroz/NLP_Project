When you're down and troubled
And you need some lovin' care
And nothing, no, nothing is goin' right
Just close your eyes and think of me
And soon, I'll be there to brighten up
Yeah, even your darkest night

[Pre-Chorus]
You just call out my name
And you know, wherever I am
I'll come a-running, yeah, yeah
To see you again

Winter, spring, summer, or fall
All you have to do is call
And I'll be there, yes, I will
You've got a friend, oh, yeah
You've got a friend
You've got a friend, oh, baby
You've got a friend

When the sky above you
Grows dark and full of clouds
And that old north wind, yeah
He begins to blow
Here's what you do, baby
You keep your head together, together, baby
And call my name out loud
And you'll hear me knocking, knocking at your door
Oh, yes, I will, yes, I will
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
You just call out my name
And you know, wherever I am
I'll come a-running, yeah, yeah
To see you again
Ooh

Winter, spring, summer, or fall
All you have to do is call
And I'll be there, yes, I will

Ain't it good to know
That you got a friend
People can be so cold
They'll hurt you, yeah, and desert you
And take your soul if you let them
But don't let them, no, no, no, don't let them
Hmm

Winter, spring, summer, or fall
All you have to do is call and I'll be there
I'll be there, yes, I will
Oh
You've got a friend, yes, you do
You've got a friend, yes, you do
Right 'til the end, right for you
Ain't it good to know
You've got a friend, yes, you do
You've got a friend, yes, you do
Right 'til the end, right for you
Ain't it good to know
You've got a friend, yes, you do
You've got a friend, yes, you do
Right 'til the end, right for you
Ain't it good to know
You've got a friend, yes, you do
You've got a friend, yes, you do
Right 'til the end, right for you5Embed
