Can it be I stayed away too long?
Did I leave your mind when I was gone?
It's not my thing trying to get back
But this time, let me tell you where I'm at
You don't have to worry 'cause I'm coming
Back to where I should have always stayed
And now, I've learned the meaning to your story
And it's enough love for me to stay
Can it be I stayed away too long?
Did I leave your mind when I was gone?
Well, it's not my thing trying to get back
But this time, let me tell you where I'm at

I wanna, wanna be where you are, oh-oh
Anywhere you are, oh-oh
I wanna, wanna be where you are, oh-oh
Everywhere you are, oh

Please don't close the door to our future
There's so many things we haven't tried
I will love you better than I used to
And give you all the love I have inside
I wanna, wanna be where you are, oh-oh
Any, any, anywhere you are, oh-oh
I wanna, wanna be where you are, oh-oh
I gotta, gotta be where you are, oh-oh

I wanna be, I wanna be, oh
Yeah, yeah, baby, now
I wanna be, I wanna be, oh
Ooh, I wanna be, I wanna be, oh
Na-na, yeah-yeah
I wanna be, I wanna be, oh
I wanna be, I wanna be, oh
Na-na, baby
I wanna be, I wanna be, oh
I wanna be, I wanna be, oh
Ooh-ooh, baby8Embed
