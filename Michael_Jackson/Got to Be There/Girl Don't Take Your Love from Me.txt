(No, no, no)
(No, no, no) No, no
(No, no, no)
(No, no, no)
No, no (No, no, no)
(No, no, no)
Ooh

Foolish of me, I couldn't see
The forest for the trees
You've been so true
I've been so cruel to you
Oh, girl, please don't leave me

If you stay, I'll find a way
To erase the past
Baby, don't leave me
Girl, don't take your love from me
Oh, girl

What can I say to make you stay?
Baby, don't leave me
You've been so kind
It blows my mind to know
Oh, girl, I really hurt you
Tell me, girl, it's not too late
And you'll give me a chance
To make it up to you
Don't take your love from me
Girl, don't take your love
(No, no, no)
(No, no, no)
No, no, no, no, no (No, no, no)
Don't take your love (No, no, no)
(No, no, no)
Ooh (No, no, no)
(Don't take your, don't take your, don't take your love)

Girl, if you take your love away from me (No, no, no)
I'm going to be in misery (No, no, no)
Your love is the strength that I lean upon (Don't take your love from me)
How will I make it when it's gone?
Of all the little things I wanted to say (No, no, no)
Or really wanted to do (No, no, no)
Girl, this time (No, no, no)
Ooh
Oh, girl, I really mean it

So tell me, girl, it's not too late
And you'll give me a chance
To make it up to you
Don't take your love from me
Girl, don't take your love
(No, no, no)
(No, no, no)
No, no, no, no, no (No, no, no)
Don't take your love (No, no, no)
(No, no, no)
Don't leave me, girl (No, no, no)
Don't take your love from me (No, no, no)
Baby, don't take your love from me (No, no, no)
Ooh, don't take your love from me (No, no, no)
Baby, don't take your love from me (No, no, no)
Ooh, don't take your love from me (No, no, no)
Baby, don't take your love from me (No, no, no)3Embed
