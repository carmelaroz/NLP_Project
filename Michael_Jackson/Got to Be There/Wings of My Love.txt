When this old world gets you down
When your spirit's on the ground
Just remember I will always be around
Just climb on the wings of my love
I'll take you high on the wings of my love

When you're feeling all alone
Like a child who's got no home
You know you've always got a place where you can go
Just climb on the wings of my love

Like a beach that knows no boundaries with all the trees
As it rushes to the seas, darling, we'll be just as free
I'll lift your spirits high, our love will fly
We'll have heaven, blue skies, and forever sunshine

'Til you break those ties that bind
'Til the day you're really mine
Anytime you want to leave your world behind
Just climb on the wings of my love

Do-doo-doo-do-doo
Do-doo-do-doo
Doo-do-doo-do-doo-do
Oh, I'll lift your spirits high, our love will fly
We'll have heaven, blue skies, and forever sunshine

We've got rainbows yet to find
And we'll find them all in time
Girl, I know, someday, we'll even touch the sky
Just climb on the wings of my love

(Anytime) Anytime you want to leave your world behind
I'll take you high on the wings of my love
(Take my hand) Just take my hand and together, we'll touch the sky
Just climb on the wings of my love
(Just remember) Just remember I will always be around
I'll take you high on the wings of my love1Embed
