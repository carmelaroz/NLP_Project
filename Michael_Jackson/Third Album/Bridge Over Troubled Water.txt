Ooh, when you're weary, feeling small
When tears are in your eyes, I'll dry them all
I'm on your side, oh, when times get rough
And friends just can't be found
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will lay me down
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will lay me down

[Jackson 5]
When you're down and out
When you're on the street
When evening falls so hard
I will comfort you

[Jermaine]
I'll take your part, oh, when darkness comes
And pain is all around
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will lay me down
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will lay me down
Oh oh

[Jackson 5]
I will lay me down
Sail on silver
I will lay me down
You might also like[Jermaine]
Sail on silver, girl
Sail on by
Your time has come to shine
All your dreams are on their way, yeah
See how they shine
Oh, if you need a friend
I'm sailing right behind
Like a bridge over troubled waters
I will ease your mind, oh

[Jermaine + Jackson 5]
I will ease your mind
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will ease your mind...oh, oh, oh
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will be your guide, baby
I will be by your sideEmbed
