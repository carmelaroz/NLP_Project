Can I see you (Can I see you)
In the morning (In the morning)
Can I see you (Can I see you)
In the morning (In the morning)

Can I see you in the morning
Like I see you late tonight
Come and hold me
Come and hold me
Come and make me feel alright
In the morning
Can I see you in the morning?

Can I see you in the morning
Must I get down on my knees?
Come and take me
Come and take me
Do with me just what you please
Just a short walk in the sunshine
In the open side by side (In the morning)
Chance to hold you
Chance to hold you
Chance to hold my head up high
In the morning
They say you're too old for me
But I know you said that you'll wait for me, wait for me, oh

[Breakdown]
Can I, see you, in the morning sun, shining bright?
I wanna see you
I wanna see you
Can I, see you, in the morning sun, shining bright? (In the morning)
Can I see you?
Can I see you?

[Outro: Michael + (Jackson 5)]
(Can I see you) In the morning
Can I see you (Can I see you)
In the morning (In the morning)
In the morning (In the morning)
Can I see you (Can I see you)
In the morning (In the morning)
Can I see you (Can I see you)
In the morning (In the morning)
Can I see you (In the morning)Embed
