If you've got time, little girl, I'd like to explain
All the do's and don'ts, all the will's and won'ts
So lend an ear, darlin' dear
(Sweet darlin' dear)

Do be sincere, and true love will appear
Don't be shy, or love will pass you by
If you will, my heart you may steal
If you don't, the game of love you lose alone

(Darlin' dear)

Do be sincere, and true love will appear
Don't be shy, or love will pass you by
If you will, my heart you may steal
If you don't, the game of love you lose alone

(First)
First I'll place my arms, so gently around you
(Then)
Then whisper "Darlin', I'm so glad I found you"
Then your lips unwind, a simple touch wouldn't mind
A kiss will stay, darlin' dear
(Sweet darlin')
Darlin', darlin' dear, yeah
(Sweet darlin' dear)
Darlin' dear
(Sweet darlin' dear)
