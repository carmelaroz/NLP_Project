There you were, beautiful
The promise of love was written on your face
You led me on with untrue kisses
You held me captured in your false embrace
Quicker than I could bat an eye
Since you were telling me goodbye

Oh, just a minute ago your love was here
All of a sudden it seemed to disappear
Sweetness was only heartaches camouflage
The love I saw in you was just a mirage

[Post-Chorus]
You promised that happiness we'd forever share
But all I have are memories of love that was never there

We use to meet in romantic places
You gave the illusion that your love was real
Now all that's left are lipstick traces
From the kisses you only pretended to feel
And now our meetings you avoid
And so my world you have destroyed
Oh, just a minute ago your love was here
All of a sudden it seemed to disappear
The way you wrecked my life was like sabotage
The love I saw in you was just a mirage

[Post-Chorus]
You brought me up just to throw me down
You left me and my dreams shattered all on the ground

Oh, oh, oh, you only filled me with despair
By showing love that wasn't there
Oh, just like the desert shows a thirsty man
Green oasis where there's only sand
You lured me into something I should have dodged
The love I saw in you was just a mirage

[Post-Chorus]
To you I gave true love from deep within
You made me hungry for your love when it was no deeper than your skin

Just like the desert shows a thirsty man
Green oasis where there's only sand
You lured me into, into something I should have dodged
The love I saw in you was just a mirage, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh oh
Just like the desert shows a thirsty man
Green oasis where there's only sand
You lured me into something I should have dodged
The love I saw in you was just a mirage, ah, ah, ah
The love I saw in you was just a mirage
The love I saw in you was just a mirage
Just like the desert shows a thirsty man
A green oasis, uh-huh, where there's only sand...Embed
