I'm goin' back to Indiana
Back to where I started from
Goin' back to Indiana
Indiana, here I come!

I spread my wings for greener pastures
I still ain't found what I was after
I've got the blues and that is why I sing
I just wanna do my thing, yeah!

I'm goin' back to Indiana
Indiana, here I come, yeah, yeah
I'm goin' back to Indiana
'Cause that's where my baby's from, yeah!

Ok Tito, you got it!

[Guitar Solo]

I'm goin' back to Indiana
Indiana, here I come
I'm goin' back to Indiana
Cause that's where my baby's from, yeah
Hollywood, you've got a lot of pretty things
I saw a lot of movie stars with diamond rings
But I ain't got my baby and I'm feelin' wrong
That's why I gotta sing my song, yeah

I'm goin' back to Indiana
Indiana, here I come
I'm goin' back to Indiana
'Cause that is where my baby's from, yeah
Ow!

[Post-Chorus]
I'm comin', I'm comin', I'm comin', I'm comin', I'm home, yeah, yeah

Ha ha Sis Boom Bah
One more time for Roosevelt High
Johny Ray, Tex, Scooter and Lorenzo too
Watch T W Brown do the boogaloo!
Ev'ry soul that passes by
This song's for you from the Jackson 5
I'm comin' home, it's plain to see
I still got Indiana soul in me!
Oh, yeah!

I'm goin' back to Indiana
Indiana, here I come
I'm goin' back to Indiana
'Cause that's where my baby's from

That's where is she is, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (Yeah)
Hoo hooEmbed
