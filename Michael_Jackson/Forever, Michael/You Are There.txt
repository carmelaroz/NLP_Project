You are there like the laughter of a child
When I need just a smile
Suddenly, the sun shines for a while
Everywhere, sounds of love are everywhere
And my heart sings along
Thanks to you, I finally got a song

Because you are there
You are there
You are there somewhere
Each time my world seems like it is falling down
Things look up just having you around
So every night, I say a prayer
Just because you're there

Like a rainbow after rain
Like the night follows day
You're the answer to the prayers I say

And you are there
You are there
You are there somewhere
No matter where I go or what I do
You are there to help me see it through
So every night, I say a prayer
Just because you're there
Ooh, you are there
Ooh, you are there somewhere
And as the years go by, we will stay as true
What you are for me, I'll be for you
And every night, I'll say a prayer
Just because you're there

Ooh, you are there
Ooh, you are there
Everywhere, you are there1Embed
