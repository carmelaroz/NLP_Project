Do it, do it, he can do it, watch him do it
I got rhythm and a whole lot of soul
(He can dance) I can shake it, baby (He can dance)

I'm just a little country boy
Harmonica in my hand
I got soulful rhythm in me
I'ma get down, dancing man

Shalalala, boom, boom
My name is Dapper Dan, ah
Shalalala, boom, boom
I'm a dancing man, ah

I'm gonna be king of the discotheque
That's where I can be found, ha
Master of the rhythm beat, oh
I've got the fastest feet around

Shalalala, boom, boom (Shalalala, mmm)
My name is Dapper Dan
(Shalalala, mmm)
Shalalala, boom, boom (Shalalala, mmm)
I'm a dancing man, yeah (Shalalala, ooh)
