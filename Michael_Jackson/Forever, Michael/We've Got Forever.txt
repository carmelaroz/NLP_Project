(We've got forever
Forever)

I'll plant you a garden
Of laughter and tears
With rain and with sunshine
Love will grow through the years

[Pre-Chorus]
The dreams that we're dreaming
Have time to come true

'Cause we've got forever
And forever is meant for so very few, mmm

We shall have music
We shall have rhyme
We shall have each other
One minute after the end of time, ooh-ooh, baby

Then we'll add up the pleasures
And treasure the sums
Caring is sharing
The cake and the crumbs
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
How lucky we are to be
Me and you

'Cause we've got forever
And forever is meant for so very few

(We got, we got, we got, we got it) Me and you, baby
(We got, we got, we got) (Forever and forever)
(We got, we got, we got, ooh)
(We got, we got, we got) We got a million tomorrows
(We got, we got, we got, we got it) Uh, yeah

(We got, we got, we got) (Forever and forever) Yeah
(We got, we got, we got, ooh) I know that we got it
(We got, we got, we got) I know that we got it
(We got, we got, we got, we got it) Ah

(We got, we got, we got) (Forever and forever) We've got, we've got, we've got
(We got, we got, we got, ooh) Got, got, yeah
(We got, we got, we got) Uh, yeah
(We got, we got, we got, we got it) Me and you, baby

(We got, we got, we got) (Forever and forever) Uh
(We got, we got, we got, ooh)
(We got, we got, we got) We got a million tomorrows
(We got, we got, we got, we got it)
(We got, we got, we got) (Forever and forever)
(We got, we got, we got, ooh)
(We got, we got, we got)Embed
