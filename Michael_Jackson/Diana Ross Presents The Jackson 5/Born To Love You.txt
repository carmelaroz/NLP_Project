Girl, as you walk by
I see the sign so deep inside
I knew it had to be
When you smiled for a little while
I heard the same rhapsody
So lovely and so fair
I knew right then and there
That you were made for me
And it wasn't hard to see

[Chorus: Michael + Jermaine + (Jackson 5)]
Guess I was born to love you
Ooh, guess I was born to love you
(Darling I, I was born to love you
Give my love to no one but you)
This is a man with the future in his hands
Don't let go (Don't let go)
Don't let go (Don't let go)
Baby, don't let go (Don't let go)
(Don't let go)

You better come on
And take my hand, 'cause I can't understand
This feeling in my soul
But I know that I would rather die
Than to let this feeling go
Oh, now, girl, can you see
That this was meant to be?
It's funny but it's true
You might also like[Chorus: Michael]
Guess I was born to love you
I guess I was born to love you, ah yeah
Guess I was born to love you, darlin' I, ah yeah...Embed
