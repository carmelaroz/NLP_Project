Hoo hoo, listen darlin', yeah yeah (Yeah yeah)
Yeah yeah (Yeah yeah)
Ooh yeah (Yeah yeah)
Ooh

It seemed like yesterday
That you were in my arms
And in a special way
You touched my heart with all your charms
And now you're gone (Now you're gone)
And I find myself (Find myself)
Baby, I'm all alone (I'm all alone)
And there's no love left (There's no love left)
Hey, hey! Don't know where I failed
It seems I always cared
And I did all I know
To win your love and make it so
You always stay but you turned away (Turned away)
Honey, what could I say?
How could you, how could you do me this way?

[Chorus: Michael]
'Cause I'm chained
To your love and affection
Chained with my heart in my only direction
You might also likeHuh huh huh huh huh huh huh huh huh huh huh

I've got to make it right
Somehow it all went wrong
Somewhere down the line
The love I lost
The love I gotta find
Whoa! And it won't be long
I've gotta make it right baby
And carry you tenderly back home

[Chorus: Michael]
I'm chained
To your love and affection
Baby, chained to your love
When I hear your name
How I tremble, how I tremble, yeah
Honey, you know, honey, you know, yeah

Oh, baby, yeah

Now I admit that I
Haven't been the perfect guy
For a girl as sweet as you
My heart and soul cries out for you
(One more chance that's all I need)
I'm gonna make it right, baby (Gonna make it right, baby)
Can you just stay, won't you stay with me?
[Chorus: Jermaine]
'Cause I'm chained
To your love and affection
Well, I'm chained with my heart in my only direction
Well, I'm chained to your love and affection
Well, well, well, well, well...Embed
