(Standing in the shadows of love
I'm getting ready or the heartaches to come)

Standing in the shadows of love
I'm getting ready for the heartaches to come
Can't you see me standing in the shadows of love?
I'm getting ready for the heartaches to come

I wanna run but there's no place to go
'Cause heartaches will find me I know
Without your love, your love I need
It's the beginning of the end of me
'Cause you've taken away all my reasons for living
When you pushed aside all the love I've been giving
Now wait a minute!

[Pre-Chorus]
Didn't I treat you right
Now baby didn't I, didn't I, didn't I?
Didn't I do the best I could
Now didn't I, didn't I?

(Don't you leave me) standing in the shadows of love
Getting ready for the heart aches to come
Can't you see me standing in the shadows of love?
I'm tryin' my best to get ready for the heart aches to come
All alone I'm destined to be
With misery my only company
It may come today, or it may come tomorrow
But it's for sure I ain't got nothing but sorrow
I thought your conscience would kinda bother you
How can you watch me cry after all I've done for you?
Hold on a minute!

[Pre-Chorus]
I gave you all the love I had
Now didn't I, didn't I, didn't I?
When you needed me I was always there
Now wasn't I, wasn't I?

Don't you leave me (standing in the shadows of love)
I'm getting ready for the heartaches to come
I'm trying not to cry out loud
'Cause all this cryin' it ain't, it ain't gonna help me none

Now what did I do, girl, to cause all this grief?
Now what did I say to make you want to leave?
Now wait a minute!

[Pre-Chorus]
I gave my heart and soul to you
Now didn't I, didn't I, didn't I?
And didn't I always treat you good
Now didn't I, didn't I?
So don't you leave me standing in the shadows of love
I'm getting ready for the heartaches to come
Standing in the shadows of love
I'm trying my best to get ready for the heartaches to come
Standing in the shadows of love
I'm getting ready for the heartaches to come
Standing in the shadows of love
I'm getting ...Embed
