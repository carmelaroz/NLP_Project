Nobody, no, nobody, said nobody
No, no, no, nobody that can love me like you do
Can love me like you do, can love me like you

(Money in the bank)
Money in the bank don't mean a thing
(Money can't buy)
Money can't buy the love you bring
Ooh, but your love, baby
Can make a blind man see, yes, it can
Can make the devil get right down on his knees

[Chorus: Jackson 5 + Michael]
Nobody, no, nobody, said nobody
No, no, no, nobody that can love me like you do
Can love me like you do, can love me like you

(Movie star queen)
A movie star queen can move me not
(Movie star queen)
Take off the paint, baby, whatcha got?
Ooh, take me, girl
You're my desire, honey
I get steaming hot every time you light my fire (Light my fire)
You might also like[Chorus: Jackson 5 + Michael]
Nobody, no, nobody, said nobody
No, no, no, nobody that can love me like you do
Can love me like you do, can love me like you

[Bridge: Jermaine + (Jackson 5)]
Baby (Baby, baby, baby)
Baby (Baby, baby, baby)
Baby (Baby, baby, baby)
Baby (Baby, baby, baby)

(The good book says)
The good book says to share with your brother
(The good book says)
When it comes to you, you better find him another
You know the wise old owl, got nothing to say
But if you loved him like you love me
He'd (hoot hoot) twenty-four hours a day!

[Chorus: Jackson 5 + Michael]
Nobody, no, nobody, said nobody
No, no, no, nobody that can love me like you do
Can love me like you do, can love me like you

[Bridge: Jermaine + Michael + (Jackson 5)]
Baby (Baby, baby, baby)
(Nobody can love me like you...)
