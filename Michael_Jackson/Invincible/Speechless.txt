Your love is magical, that's how I feel
But I have not the words here to explain
Gone is the grace for expressions of passion
But there are worlds and worlds of ways to explain
To tell you how I feel, but I am

Speechless, speechless
That's how you make me feel
Though I'm with you
I am far away and nothing is for real

[Post-Chorus]
When I'm with you, I am lost for words
I don't know what to say
My head's spinning like a carousel
So silently, I pray

Helpless and hopeless, that's how I feel inside
Nothing's real, but all is possible if God is on my side
When I'm with you, I'm in the light where I can not be found
It's as though I am standing in the place called 'Hallowed Ground'

Speechless (Speechless), speechless (Speechless)
That's how you make me feel
Though I'm with you (Ooh)
I am far away and nothing is for real
You might also like[Post-Chorus]
I'd go anywhere and do anything
Just to touch your face
There's no mountain high I can not climb
I'm humbled in your grace

Speechless, speechless
That's how you make me feel
Though I'm with you
I am lost for words and nothing is for real
Speechless, speechless
That's how you make me feel
Though I'm with you
I am far away, and nothing is for real
Speechless, speechless
That's how you make me feel (You're always in my heart)
Though I'm with you
I am lost for words and nothing is for real
Speechless

Your love is magical, that's how I feel
But in your presence, I am lost for words
Words like... like, "I love you"10Embed
