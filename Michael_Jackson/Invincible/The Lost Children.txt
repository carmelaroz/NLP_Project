We pray for our fathers
Pray for our mothers
Wishing our families well
We sing songs for the wishing, of those who are kissing
But not for the missing

So this one’s for all the lost children
This one’s for all the lost children
This one’s for all the lost children, wishing them well
And wishing them home

When you sit there addressing
Counting your blessings
Biding your time
When you lay me down sleeping
And my heart is weeping
Because I'm keeping a place

For all the lost children
This is for all the lost children
This one’s for all the lost children, wishing them well
And wishing them home
Home with their fathers
Snug close and warm, loving their mothers
I see the door simply wide open
But no one can find thee

Let's pray for all the lost children
Let’s pray for all the lost children
Just think of all the lost children, wishing them well
This is for all the lost children
This one’s for all the lost children
Just think of all the lost children
Wishing them well and wishing them home

Eighty-five, ninety, ninety-five, one hundred
Here I come, ready or not
Last one into the forest is a rotten apple
It's so quiet in the forest
Look at all the trees
And all the lovely flowers
It's getting dark
We better go home now8Embed
