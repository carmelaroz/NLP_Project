Ooh, don't walk away
Walk away

Don't walk away
See, I just can't find the right thing to say
I tried but all my pain gets in the way
Tell me what I have to do so you’ll stay
Should I get down on my knees and pray?

How can I stop losing you?
How can I begin to say
When there’s nothing left to do but walk away? Yeah

I close my eyes
Just to try and see you smile one more time
But it's been so long, now, all I do is cry
Can’t we find some love to take this away?
'Cause the pain gets stronger every day

How can I begin again?
How am I to understand
When there’s nothing left to do but walk away? Yeah
See, and why
All my dreams been broken
I don't know where we’re going
With everything we said and all we done now
Don't let go, I don't wanna walk away
Oh, ooh-ooh-ooh
And why?
All my dreams been broken
I don’t know where we’re going
When everything begins to set us free
Can't you see? I don't wanna walk away

If you go, I won't forget you, girl (Please don't go)
Can't you see that you will always be? (You will always be)
Even though I had to let you go (Don't you leave me, don't you leave me)
There’s nothing left to do
Don't walk away
If you go, I won't forget you, girl (Please, please don't leave, you will always)
Can't you see that you will always be? (Can't you see you and me?)
Even though (You will always be), I had to let you go
Better leave now, don't you leave me
When there's nothin' left to do
Don't walk away
If you go, I won't forget you, girl (Oh, no, oh, yeah, baby girl)
Can't you see? (You and me), that you will always be (I won't forget you, girl, I won't forget you, girl)
Even though (I won't forget you, girl), I had to let go
Better leave now, better leave now
There's nothin' left do
Don't walk away5Embed
