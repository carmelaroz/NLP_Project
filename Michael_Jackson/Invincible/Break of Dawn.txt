Hold my hand
Feel the touch of your body cling to mine
You and me, makin' love
All the way through another night
I remember you and I
Walkin' through the park at night
Kiss and touch, nothin' much
Let it blow, just touch and go
Love me more, never leave me alone by house of love
People talk, people say
What we have is just a game
Oh, I’ll never let you go
Come here, girl
Just got to make sweet love ‘til the break of dawn

I don’t want the sun to shine, I wanna make love
(It's the break of dawn)
Just this magic in your eyes
And in my heart (Break of dawn)
I don’t know what I’m gon' do
I can’t stop lovin' you
(It's the break of dawn)
I won’t stop ‘til break of dawn makin' love
Hold my hand, feel the sweat
Yes, you’ve got me nervous yet
Let me groove, let me soothe
Let me take you on a cruise
There’s imagination
I bet you've never been there before
Have you ever wanted to dream
About those things you never known?

[Pre-Chorus]
(Break of dawn, break of dawn)
There’s no sun up in the sky
(Break of dawn, break of dawn)
I can see it in your eyes
(Break of dawn, break of dawn)
Girl, you got to understand
It’s the way that I love you
Let me show you I’m your man
Break of dawn

I don’t want the sun to shine
I wanna make love
(It's the break of dawn)
Just this magic in your eyes and in my heart (It's the break of dawn)
I don’t know what I’m gon' do
I can’t stop lovin' you
I won’t stop ‘til break of dawn makin' love
(It's the break of dawn)
I don’t want the sun to shine
I wanna make love
(It's the break of dawn)
Just this magic in your eyes and in my heart
(It's the break of dawn)
I don’t know what I’m gon' do
I can’t stop lovin' you
(Break of dawn)
I won’t stop ‘til break of dawn makin' love
Let’s not wait, the sun is out
Let’s get up and let’s get out
It’s the day, a brand new day
Let’s both go outside and play
Let us walk down the park, makin' love ‘til it’s dark
Let me move ya, let me soothe ya
‘Til the break of dawn
And you know it’s true, oh

I don’t want the sun to shine, I wanna make love
(Break of dawn)
Just this magic in your eyes and in my heart
(Break of dawn)
I don’t know what I’m gon' do, I can’t stop lovin' you
(I don't know, I don't know)
I won’t stop ‘til break of dawn makin' love
(I don't want)
I don’t want the sun to shine, I wanna make love
(I don't know, I don't know, no, no, no, no, no)
Just this magic in your eyes and in my heart
(It's the break of dawn)
I don’t know what I’m gon' do, I can’t stop lovin' you
(It's the break of dawn)
I won’t stop ‘til break of dawn makin' love
(Oh)
I don’t want the sun to shine, I wanna make love
(I don't want, I don't want
It's the break of dawn)
Just this magic in your eyes and in my heart
(It's magic, it's, it's dawn)
I don’t know what I’m gon' do, I can’t stop lovin' you
(I don't know, know
Break of dawn)
I won’t stop ‘til break of dawn makin' love
