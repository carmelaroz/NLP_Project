I thought she had to have it
Since the first time she came
Who knows the situation
Mysteries do remain
And now, I wonder why
I break down when I cry
Is it something I said
Or is it just a lie? (Is it just a lie)
I try so hard to love you
Some things take time and shame
I think the whole world of you
Your thoughts of me remain
I'll play the fool for you
I'll change the rules for you
Just say it and I'll do
Just make this dream come true (Make a dream come true)
If I let her get away
Though I'm begging on my knees
I'll be crying everyday
Knowing the girl that got away

[Hook]
I can't let, I can't let her get away
I can't let, I can't let her get away
I can't let, I can't let her get away
I can't let, I can't let her get away
I tried to mastermind it
By saying let you be
But everytime I did it
The hurt came back at me
I told you that I need you
A thousand times and why
I played the fool for you
And still, you said goodbye (Still, you said goodbye)
If I let her get away
Then the world will have to see
A fool who lives alone
And the fool who set you free

[Hook]
I can't let, I can't let her get away
I can't let, I can't let her get away
I can't let, I can't let her get away
I can't let, I can't let her get away

I got the feeling trouble's gotta stop
I got the feeling she's never gonna drop
I got the feeling she's never gonna stop
I got the feeling but she's never gonna know
My friends thought she's gonna like it
I got the feeling but she's never gonna take it
I got the feeling her head's all fucked up
I got the feeling she's out to play
[Break]
(Can't let go, oh)
I got to let go, I got a feeling but she's never gonna let me
(Can't let go, oh)
Gotta see her, how are they gonna stop me?
I got a feeling, but she's never gonna be
Got a feeling, but she's gonna find a way
I never feel it, but she's never gonna find a way

[Hook]
I can't let, I can't let her get away
I can't let, I can't let her get away
I can't let, I can't let her get away
I can't let, I can't let her get away7Embed
