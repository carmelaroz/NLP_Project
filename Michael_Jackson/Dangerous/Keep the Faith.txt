If you called out loud, would it get inside
Through the heart of your surrender, to your alibis?
And you can say the words like you understand
But the power's in believin', so give yourself a chance

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause you can climb the highest mountain
Swim the deepest sea, hee
All you need is the will to want it and a little self-esteem

So keep the faith, don't let nobody turn you 'round
You got to know when it's good to go
To get your dreams up off of the ground, ah
Keep the faith, baby, yeah
Because it's just a matter of time
Before your confidence will win out
Believe in yourself, no matter what it's gonna take
You can be a winner, but you got to keep the faith

[Post-Chorus]
Ah, gon' keep it, brother
You got it

(Ooh-ooh) And when you think of trust, does it lead you home (Oh, ah-ah)
To a place that you only dream of when you're all alone?
(Ooh-ooh) And you can go by the feel 'stead of circumstance
But the power's in believin', so give yourself a chance
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
I know that you can sail across the water
Float across the sky, ah
Any road that you take will get you there
If you'll only try

So keep the faith, ow
Don't let nobody take you down, brother (Don't you)
Just keep your (Faith) eyes on the prize (Faith)
And your feet flat on the ground
So keep the faith, baby, yeah (Ah-ah)
Because it's just a matter of time (Only)
Before your confidence will win out

(Ah-ah-ah) Lift up your head and show the world ya got pride
(Ah-ah-ah) Go for what you want, don't let 'em get in your way
You can be better, but you got to keep the faith
