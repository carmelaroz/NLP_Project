Freaky bitches wanna menage 'cause I’m a star
Came through on a private jet and motorcade cars (Phew)
First time I hopped on a jet, flew to a check (Phew)
Drinking wine and eating sandwiches, weird flex
I come with amenities like a five-star (Aye, five-star, aye)
Make these bitches wanna drive me like a fast car
And I be like, "Wow"
They be all impressed by whеre I’m at now
The way I’m in the fiеld, look like a touchdown
Lately, I been all in my bag, fuck your Goyard
Drip like water, whip in the 80s, I’m going hard
Look at who I’m with, I'm a rich son of a bitch
Working day and night, Michael Jackson, but this ain't it

Bitch, this ain't poppin', this the prelude
Bitch, this ain't poppin', this the prelude
Bitch, this ain't poppin', this the prelude
Bitch, this ain't poppin', this the...
Bitch, this ain't poppin', this the prelude
Bitch, this ain't poppin', this the prelude
Bitch, this ain't poppin', this the prelude
Bitch, this ain't poppin', this the...
And this ain't even poppin'
It's either this or going to sleep on a palet
Surrounded by diamonds, different color palette
I’m with a bougie bitch with an expensive palette
Now she wanna add this drip to her palette
Baby like this taste

And, bitch, this ain't poppin', this the prelude
Bitch, this ain't poppin', this the prelude
