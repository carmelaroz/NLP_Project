Ah, ah, ah, ah (Hoo!)

This time around, I'll never get bit
Though you really wanna fix me, uh (Ah)
This time around, you're makin' me sick
Though you really want to get me (Ah)
Somebody's out, somebody's out to get me
They really want to fix me, hit me (Uh)
But this time around, I'm takin' no shit
Though you really want to get me
You really want to get me

[Chorus: Michael Jackson]
He really thought he really had a hold of me
He really thought (They thought they really had control of me) he really had control of me
He really thought he really had a hold of me
He really thought (They thought they really had control of me) he really had control of me

This time around, I'll never get bit
Oh, you really want to get me (You really want to get me)
But this time around, I'm takin' no shit
Though you really want to fix me (Uh, you really want to fix me)
Somebody's out, somebody's out to use me
You really to use me and then falsely accuse me (Accuse me)
This time around, they'll take it like spit
Though you really can't control me (Uh, you really can't control me)
You know you can't control me, ugh

Listen, I got problems of my own (Uh)
Flashin' cameras, taps on my phone (Uh-huh)
Even in my home, I ain’t safe as I should be
Things always missin', maybe it could be (Uh)
My friends, but they ain’t friends if they robbin' me
Stoppin' me, from makin' a profit, see
Apology shallow like the ocean (Uh-huh)
I guess I'll resort to gun-totin'
If I was dead broke and smokin', I'd probably be by my lonesome
I'ma kill a nigga, I ain’t joking, Indo smoke got me chokin' (Uh)
I'm hopin' a fool come slippin', so I can blow him open
This time around, I changed up my flow (Uh-huh)
Got rid of the Rotts, got Pits by the door (Uh)
A real set of peoples to watch my back (Uh-huh)
Stay away from strangers so I won't slack
And I know my nigga Mike like that, baby (This time around, yeah)
