I was wanderin' in the rain
(Mask of life feelin' insane)
Swift and sudden fall from grace
(Sunny days seem far away)
Kremlin's shadow belittlin' me
(Stalin's tomb won't let me be)
On and on and on, it came
(Wish the rain would just let meâ€”)

How does it feel (How does it feel?)
How does it feel
How does it feel
When you're alone and you're cold inside?

Here abandoned in my fame
(Armageddon of the brain)
KGB was doggin' me (Hee)
(Take my name and just let me be)
But then a beggar boy (Hee) called my name
(Happy days will drown the pain)
On and on and on, it came and the rain
And again, and again
(Take my name and just let me)
How does it feel (How does it feel?)
How does it feel
How does it feel
How does it feel
How does it feel (How does it feel now?)
How does it feel
How does it feel
When you're alone and you're cold inside?

[Interlude]
(Yeah, Michael!)

How does it feel (How does it feel?)
How does it feel
How does it feel
How does it feel
How does it feel (How does it feel now?)
How does it feel
How does it feel
When you're alone and you're cold inside?

[Breakdown]
Like a stranger in Moscow
Lord, have mercy
Like a stranger in Moscow (Hee)
Lord, have mercy
We're talkin' danger
We're talkin' danger, baby
Like a stranger in Moscow
We're talkin' danger
We're talkin' danger, baby
Like a stranger in Moscow
I'm livin' lonely
I'm livin' lonely, baby
Stranger in Moscow

Why have you come from the West?
Confess, to steal the great achievements of the people
