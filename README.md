In our project, we aimed to explore how the events in Michael Jackson's life influenced the evolution of his musical style over the years. To achieve this, we utilized natural language processing tools such as SpaCy and Scikit-learn. These tools enabled us to analyze various aspects of his lyrics, including word frequency, verb and noun usage, poem length, themes, punctuation, and more. We visualized the collected data through graphs, which allowed us to thoroughly examine and understand the stylistic changes in his work.
