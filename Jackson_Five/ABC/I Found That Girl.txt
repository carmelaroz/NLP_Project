(Oooh ooh
Mama, oh mama, I found that girl
Mama, oh mama, I found that girl)

Mama, life for me now is a new sensation
Just like you said it would be with the right situation
Now love has a meaning and I have a goal
This feeling inside me now makes yester-me a hundred years old

[Pre-Chorus]
Now I understand (I understand)
What is it to be a man (To be a man)
The way you explained it to me that day
You said only the right girl can make me feel this way, well

Mama, I think I found that girl (I found that girl)
Yeah, Mama, I think I found that girl (I found that girl)

Ooh, Mama, she's that beautiful dream that I dream each night
She's that bird of love, on whose wings I've been flying
She's those words left when there's no more to say
She's my sunshine at the end of a perfect day
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
All this lets me find (Lets me find)
A reason to be alive (To be alive)
The day when you sat me upon your knee
You said only the right girl could be all these things

Mama, I think I found that girl (I found that girl)
Yeah, Mama, I think I found that girl (I found that girl)

[Pre-Chorus]
You said, "Son, go on and search around
Theres a good girl who's out there to be found."

And Mama, I think I found that girl (I found that girl)
Yeah, Mama, I think I found that girl (I found that girl)

Ooh
(Mama, oh, Mama)
Woah oh oh, woah oh oh
(I found that girl)
Mmmm hmm
(Mama, oh, Mama)
Mama, I know, I know I found that girl
(I found that girl)Embed
