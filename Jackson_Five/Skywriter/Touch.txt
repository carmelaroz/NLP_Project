Reach out and touch
Reach out and touch

[Michael]
Darlin' just relax
You melt me like hot candle wax
One touch and my whole body melts
You just say, you say you can't express yourself

[Jermaine + (Jackson 5) + Michael]
Oh, just keep doing what you're doing
Fancy words will only ruin it
(Touch) Touch me
(That very special touch)
If I satisfy you (If I satisfy you)
How can you satisfy me, baby?

[Michael]
Don't you worry baby why
You see these tears of love in my eyes
I feel this love flowing through
Like a river, girl, straight from me to you

[Jermaine + (Jackson 5) + Michael]
Your touch means than words
Than any language ever heard
(Touch) Touch me
(That very special touch)
Every brand new day (Every brand new day)
I wake up wanting you the same ole way
