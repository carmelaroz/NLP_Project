You better get it together
Or leave it alone
If you don't want my lovin'
I'll be gone
Get up, get up, get up

[Michael]
Get up off your high horse, girl
Think what you're doin', doin'
Get up off your high horse, girl
Think what you're doin' doin'
(I'm spinnin' around)
I'm spinnin' around
On your merry-go-round
You got me dizzy, dizzy, dizzy, dizzy, dizzy

Get it together
Or leave it alone (Or leave it alone)
If you don't want my lovin'
I'll be gone
Now, now baby
Get it together
Or leave it alone (You better get it, get it, get it)
If you don't want my lovin'
I'll be gone

Get up off your high horse girl
Think what you're doin', doin'
Get up off your high horse girl
Think what you're doin' doin'

[Michael]
I can't stand all this confusion
All this shuckin' and jivin'
Keeps puttin' me down, down, down

Get it together (Get it)
Or leave it alone (Leave it alone)
If you don't want my lovin'
I'll be gone (Gone, gone, gone, gone, gone)

[Michael]
Think, girl, what you're doin'
Throwin' this heart of mine all away
Oh, think, girl, you know I love ya
To keep a love like mine is hard this day
All you gotta do, girl

Get it together
Or leave it alone
If you don't want my lovin'
I'll be gone
Get it together
Or leave it alone
If you don't want my lovin'
I'll be gone (Gone, gone, gone, gone, gone)
Get it together
Or leave it alone (Leave it alone)
Well, well, well, well, well, well, well
Ha, nah-nah2Embed
