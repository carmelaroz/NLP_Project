Ooh, I'd love to be with you

Old man sun
He don't have to come
I'll keep warm with your smile
And when my troubles get bad and I should be sad
I'm happy all the while

[Pre-Chorus: Michael + Jermaine + (Jackson 5)]
Mmm, I forget the world outside
Having your love, enjoying life
(Just me and you)
What a lovely way to spend my time

Ooh, I'd love to be with you

Darling, you turn my work into play
It's just one big holiday
Baby, having so much fun
Ooh, there's nothin' we'll leave undone
(Just me and you)
What a lovely way to spend my time
Ooh, I'd love to be with you

[Bridge: Michael + Jermaine + (Jackson 5)]
You're heaven on earth for me, yeah
Oh, no other address could there be
There's no other place for me
Than with you (You baby)
(My whole life through)

[Outro: Jackson 5 + Jermaine + (Michael)]
You're my inspiration (Yes, you are, my love)
What a sensation (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Ooh, I'd love to be with you (Oh, what a feeling)
Ooh, I'd love to be with you (Yeah, yeah)
Ooh, I'd love to be with you (To be with you, baby)
Ooh, I'd love to be with you
Ooh, I'd love to be with you...Embed
