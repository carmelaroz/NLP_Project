It feels alright, the grass is high
Live your life, before it passes by
Travel the road of the countryside
From city to city we're taking a ride

World of sunshine, bright shades of gold, yeah
It's time to be happy, yeah yeah, for the young and old
World of sunshine, world of sunshine
World of sunshine, yeah

Come with me, there's so much to see
There's people to meet, and places you should be
When you get tired, you can always find, hey, hey, hey
A mile to rest area sign

World of sunshine, bright shades of gold
It's time to be happy for the young and old
Travel the road of the countryside, yeah yeah yeah
From city to city, we're taking a ride
World of sunshine, bright shades of gold
It's time to be happy for the young and old
World of sunshine, bright shades of gold
It's time to be happy for the young and old
World of sunshine, bright shades of gold...You might also likeEmbed
