Doo-doo-doo-doo-wah (Ow!)
Doo-doo-doo-doo-wah

The love we're standing on is shaky ground
There ain't no way on earth to hold you down
And every road I take to you is still losing, oh yeah, ha
I'm gonna find a boat to row away
Where I won't be reaching for you night and day
Where there's no windows, ain't no doors
To let your love in, oh I, I

[Chorus: Jackson 5, Michael Jackson]
I can't quit your love (Oh yeah)
No matter how hard I try to
I can't quit your love (No, I can't)
I keep running back to you
You know I can't quit your love, oh yeah!
Doo-doo-doo-doo-wah

You snap your fingers and I feel on fire
Like silly spinning wheels of desire
You have to be a bird with wings to get me higher
(Higher, higher, higher)
The mind that makes for me has fool's control, ho
The weakness of my judgement rules my soul
You know you've got each nerve me down to the wire, oh!
You might also like[Chorus: Jackson 5, Michael Jackson]
I can't quit your love (Can't quit your love)
No matter how hard I try to
I can't quit your love (No, no, no)
I keep running back to you
You know I can't quit your love, oh yow

[Bridge: Jermaine Jackson, Michael Jackson, Jackson 5]
I can't quit your love, baby
(Well, well, well, well)
Can't quit your love
I can't quit your love
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
(Well, well, well, well, well, well)
I can't quit your love
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
(Well, well, well, well, well, well)
Can't quit your love
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah) (Well)
I can't quit your love
Doo-doo-doo-doo-wah, ow

[Chorus: Jackson 5, Michael Jackson]
I can't quit your love (Can't quit your love)
No matter how hard I try to
(Can't quit it, can't quit it, can't quit it, can't quit it)
I can't quit your love (Can't quit your love)
I keep running back to you
(Can't quit it, can't quit it, can't quit it, can't quit it)
I can't quit your love (Can't quit your love)
No matter how hard I try to
(Can't quit it, can't quit it, can't quit it, can't quit it)
I can't quit your love (Can't quit your love)
I keep running back to youEmbed
