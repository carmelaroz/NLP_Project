Thanks a lot

You made me (you made me) what I am today
You made me what I am today

[Michael + Jermaine]
You knew me when
But still you loved me
You stuck with me through thick and thin, yeah
You took my hand
And then you showed me
The opportunity at the end
(You pushed me right up to the top)

You made me (you made me) what I am today
You made me what I am today

[Michael + Jermaine]
Fame and fortune
Ain't change my name
That's not the life I want to lead, no no
Success is costly
Had friends that left me
And a friend in need is a friend indeed

I know who my friends are
I know who you are

You made me (you made me) what I am today
You made me what I am today

Testify, testify...come on, testify
Testify, testify...come on, testify

[Michael + (Jackson 5)]
The room was dark
When I said I do look for love
And you let the light shine through (oh testify)
I used to wish that I could touch the sky above
And you made it all come true (whoa, testify)
It was you
(Thank you, love)
(Thank you, baby)
It was you
(Thank you, love)
(Thank you, baby)

You made me (you made me) what I am today
You made me what I am today
