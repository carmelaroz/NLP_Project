Where the grapes grew high on the vine
Yeah, that’s where we first met little girl

But you ain’t gonna amount to nothing
Cause you ain’t gonna work for nothing
Without you I ain’t good for nothing, honey chile
Oh honey chile, you’re sure about to drive me wild

And I love you so, can’t let go now honey chile
Oh, sugar chile, I’d walk me a country mile
Just to be with you if that were true but honey chile

You don’t act like a lady
Cause you’ve been courting Davie
Its reputation shady oh honey chile
Hey you even went out with Callie
That night across the alley
Oh, I’ve been keeping tally honey chile

You’re like grapes upon the vine
That went in Granny’s wine
Cause like that home-made wine so sweet
You’re sure enough driving me out of my mind now

Your friends with every playboy
Using me for a play toy
You ruined my pride and joy now honey chile
You might also likeOh honey chile, sure about to drive me wild
And I love you so, can’t let go now honey chile
Oh, sugar chile, I’d walk me a country mile
Just to be with you if that were true of honey chile

Why don’t you put on your shoes little girl
Then I can kiss you
Oh listen here now

One day I’m gonna get stronger
And I won’t need you no longer
This feeling will be gone oh honey chile

Hey, I can’t take disgracing
That ain’t the way Grandma raised me
You’re gonna hurt me crazy honey chile

Hey, sugar chile, I’d walk me a country mile
Just to be with you if that were true of honey chile
Hey honey chile, sure about to drive me wild
And I love you so, can’t let go now honey chileEmbed
