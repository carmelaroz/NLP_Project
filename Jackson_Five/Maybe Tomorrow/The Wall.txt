You hold me close to you, my baby
But somehow it doesn't feel the same
You built the wall so high between us
And you tell me that you haven't changed, oh

Tear down the wall that I can feel between us
The hidden wall that hides the real love
Tear it on down, tear the wall down
Tell me my love has got the strength to take it
Tell me what's wrong, we'll make it
Tear it on down, yeah, tear the wall down

I thought I really knew you, baby
Almost the way I know myself
But now you're actin' like a stranger
And you've changed, girl, to somebody else, oh baby

Tear down the wall that I can feel between us
The hidden wall that hides the real love
Tear it on down, tear the wall down
Oh, tell me my love has got the strength to take it
Tell me what's wrong, we'll make it
Tear it on down, yeah, tear the wall down, ooh
Tear down the wall that I can feel between us
The hidden wall that hides the real love
Tear it on down, yeah, tear the wall down, oh...You might also likeEmbed
