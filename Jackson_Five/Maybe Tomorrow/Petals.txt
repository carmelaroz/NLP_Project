When my honey says she loves me so
Believe me, y'all, it's far from status quo
A grain of salt I take with her heart
'Cause after her next breath, that girl may love me not, oh...

[Pre-Chorus: Michael + Jackson 5]
She tells my I'm so sweet
Sugar can't compete
Then puts me on the shelf
Crying by myself

Throwing petals, petals, tossing petals on the ground
Yesterday she picked me up just to throw me down
Those petals, petals, tell me what will it be today?
Will she walk into my arms or will she walk away?

[Post-Chorus]
She'll wake up some day and see
You're the only one she needs
Don't give up, just stick around
You'll be up instead of down

She keeps telling me she wants me near
(She keeps telling me she wants me near)
But half the time it's far from crystal clear
Fickle-heart must be her middle name
(Fickle-heart must be her middle name)
'Cause loving her is just a guessing game, oh
You might also like[Pre-Chorus: Michael + Jackson 5]
She calls up to say
Be there right away
Then leaves me sitting home
All alone and...

Throwing all those petals, petals, tossing petals on the ground
Yesterday she picked me up just to throw me down
Those petals, petals, tell me what will it be today?
Will she walk into my arms or will she walk away?

[Bridge: Michael + (Jackson 5)]
She loves me (loves me, loves me)
And I feel like a king!
She loves me not (loves me not, she loves me not)
Huh! I've lost everything! Oh!

Petals, petals, tossing petals on the ground
Yesterday she picked me up just to thow me down
Yesterday I couldn't lose (yesterday I couldn't lose)
But today I sing the blues

Oh! Petals, petals, petals, petals
Ooh, ooh! Petals, petals, petals, petals
Petals, petals, petals, petals
Petals, petals, petals, petals
Petals, petals, tossing petals on the ground
Yesterday she picked me up just to thow me down
Tell me, tell me, tell me, what will it be today?Embed
