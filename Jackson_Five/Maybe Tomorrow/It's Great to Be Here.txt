So glad, so glad, so glad, so glad
To be back in your arms
Thank you, baby; thank you, baby; thank you, baby
Back where I belong

Oh, I went out to do my thing
And I was totally rejected
I put you down for love unknown
But it wasn't what I expected
So frightened and confused
I came running back to you
I got right down on my knees
And said "Darling, won't you please"
I don't know why you did it
But I'm not too proud to admit it, baby

[Chorus: Jackson 5 + Michael]
Thank you, baby; thank you, baby
Back where I belong
It's great to be here, great to be here, oooh
It's great to be here in your arms
Back where I belong, woo

Adventure grabbed my heart
And took me away from you, honey
I met all kinds of pretty girls
In every town that I passed through
But that fiery senorita
Burned me down in Mexico
And I got kisses cold as ice
From my Alaskan Eskimo
I feel guilty and ashamed
But I'm gonna say it just the same, baby
You might also like[Chorus: Jackson 5 + Michael]
Thank you, baby; thank you, baby, yeah
Back where I belong
It's great to be here, great to be here , oooh
It's great to be here in your arms

[Bridge: Jackson 5 + Jermaine]
Gotta get this se√±orita
She gave me I'll just si ya!
While kissing in the igloo
My Eskimo said no no!

[Chorus: Jackson 5 + Michael]
Yeah, baby
So glad, so glad, so glad, so glad, so glad
To be back in your arms
It's great to be here, great to be here
It's great to be here in your arms
Back where I belong
Baby, baby, baby, baby, ow!
It's great to be here, great to be here, ooh
It's great to be here in your arms, yeah
Back where I belong
It's great to be here, great to be here
It's great to be here in your arms
Back where I belong
Baby, baby, baby, baby, yeah
It's great to be here, great to be here
It's great to be here in your arms
Back where I belong
I'm so glad
It's great to be here, great to be here, ooh ooh
It's great to be here in your arms
Back where I belong...Embed
