Happy birthday
Happy birthday
I love you so

Sixteen candles
Make a lovely sight
But not as bright
As your hazel eyes
Blow out the candles, baby
Make a wish come true
Blow out three wishes
That you love me too
(That you love me too)

[Chorus: Jermaine + (Jackson 5)]
You're only sixteen (Oh girl)
But you're my teenage queen (Sixteen)
But you're the prettiest and the loveliest girl
You're the loveliest I've ever seen (I've ever seen)

[Post-Chorus: Jermaine + (Jackson 5)]
Sixteen candles
In my heart will glow
Forever and ever
Oh, I love you so (I love you so)
You might also like[Chorus: Jermaine + (Jackson 5)]
You're only sixteen (Oh girl)
But you're my teenage queen (Sixteen)
But you're the prettiest and the loveliest girl
You're the loveliest I've ever seen (I've ever seen)

[Post-Chorus: Jermaine + (Jackson 5)]
Sixteen candles
In my heart will glow
Forever and ever
Oh, I love you so

[Outro: Jermaine + Jackson 5]
