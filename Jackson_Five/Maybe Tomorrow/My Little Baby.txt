All my friends keep asking what do I see in you
Through their eyes your beauty doesn't show
Ooh, all they ask is justified looking through the naked eye
But through the eyes of my love I see
The inner beauty of you

[Chorus: Michael + (Jackson 5)]
That's why you're my little baby (my little baby)
That's why you're my little baby (my little baby)
I don't want love on the skin
It's got to come from deep within
That's why you're my little baby (my little baby)
My little baby (my little baby)
My heart controls my eyes
And your love I visualize, oh yeah!

All your so-called girlfriends who compliment your clothes
Know that they're you mama's hand-me-downs
Oooh, the fashion world's turning so fast
You're still trying to catch the past
But in my world of love your style
I know will always last

[Chorus: Michael + (Jackson 5)]
That's why you're my little baby (my little baby)
That's why you're my little baby (my little baby)
I don't care what experts say
Our love is tailor-made
That's why you're my little baby (my little baby)
My my my my little baby (my little baby)
Like a brand-new ermine coat
You keep me warm as toast, little baby
You might also like[Bridge 1: Jackson 5 + Michael]
You know it's true, little baby
You know it's true, babe
You know it's true, little baby
You know it's true, babe
I'm sticking with you, little baby
I'm sticking with you, girl
I'm sticking with you, little baby

[Bridge 2: Jermaine + Michael + (Jackson 5)]
Always thrill me when you touch me
Honey, you thrill me when you kiss me, little baby, yeah
Oh, sweet baby, baby
I've got to say I'm thankful that you're
My little baby (my little baby), my little baby (my little baby)
You fill me up with pride (oh yeah)
Every time you're by my side, now now now now

[Outro: Michael + (Jackson 5)]
Oh yeah, you're my little baby (my little baby)
My little baby (my little baby), my little baby (my little baby)
I've got to say I'm thankful that you're my little baby (my little baby)
My little baby (my little baby)
Oh yeah  (my little baby), baby, yeah yeah
My little baby (my little baby), my little baby (my little baby)
Ooh yeah, baby (my little baby)Embed
