Ready, get ready, yeah...

Ready or not, here I come, you can't hide
Gonna find you and keep you happy
Ready or not, here I come, you can't hide
Gonna love you and make you love me

You can't run away (you can't run away)
From this love I got, oh baby, (you can't run away)
Hey baby, 'cause I got a lot, yeah
Anywhere you go (anywhere you go)
My poor heart got to know, oh baby
Hey baby, you can't hide from my love, oh no

Ready or not, here I come, you can't hide
Gonna find you and keep you happy
Ready or not, here I come, you can't hide
Gonna love you and make you love me

Anywhere you go (anywhere you go)
My poor heart got to know, oh baby, hey baby
You can't hide from my love, oh no, yeah yeah, mmm-hmm
