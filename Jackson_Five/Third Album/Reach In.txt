Can't find no rhyme to it all
But still we keep on trying
The why and where of it all
Inside you the answer is lying

[Chorus: Michael + (Jackson 5)]
Reach in (reach in)
Find that tree of wisdom
Reach in (reach in)
Find out why you're livin'
Reach in (reach in)
Pull away that shade of sin
And let love shine in…
And let love shine in…
Shine, shine, shine, shine…

Don't take the easy way out
Believe there is a Maker
Don't be a body of doubt
In whom does live a faker

[Chorus: Michael + (Jackson 5)]
Reach in (reach in)
Find that tree of wisdom
Reach in (reach in)
Find out why you're livin'
Reach in (reach in)
Pull away that shade of sin
And let love shine in…
And let love shine in…
A soul without love
Is a soul without meaning
And the Lord up above
He'll destroy every being

[Michael]
Reach in...ooh, reach in...ooh yeah, tell 'em, baby

[Chorus: Michael + (Jackson 5)]
Reach in (reach in)
Find that tree of wisdom
Reach in (reach in)
Find out why you're livin'
Reach in (reach in)
Reach in, oh oh, why don't you, why don't you, why don't you
Why don't you reach in, into your soul, oh
Reach in (reach in)
Find the tree of wisdom
Reach in (reach in)
Find out why you're livin'
Reach in, reach in, yeah
Come on, girl, now
Reach in, ooh, ooh
Reach in (reach in)
Find the tree of wisdom
Reach in (reach in)
Find out why you're livin'
Reach in (reach in)
Reach in...Embed
