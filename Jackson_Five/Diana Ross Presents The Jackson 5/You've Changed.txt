Hoo-hoo-hoo!
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

I remember when you was a little girl
I say you never, ever, ever wore curls
You wore nothing but an ole shaggy, shaggy dress
I say you never ever tried to look your best

Now when I look at you
All my love come running through
You've changed and it's showing yeah
My love for you has grown (my love has grown)
You've changed and it showing (Ohh)

Yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Your legs were little, but now they are big
Instead of wearing ponytails
You got a little ole red wig
Your eyes are pretty, you got some kissable lips
And I love they way you walk, way you sway your little hips
Now when I look at you
All my love come running through
You've changed and it's showing
My love for you is growing, yeah
You've changed and it showing

Hoo hoo
Yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

(Your walk) Ooh baby, I love the way you walk
(Your talk) Ooh, the way you speak to me
(Your looks) Ooh, my honey sugar
(Your eyes) ooh ooh baby, hypnotise

Now when I look at you
All my love comes running through
(You changed and it's showing)
Ooh, you changed and it's showing
(My love for you is growing)
My love, my love, my love is growing
(You changed and it's showing)
Hoo, you changed and it's showing
Yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

(Your walk) Ooh baby, I love the way you walk
(Your talk) Your talk, your talk, hoo, now
(Your looks) Ooh, my honey sugarEmbed
