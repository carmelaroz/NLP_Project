La la la la la la, la la la la la la la
La la la la la la, la la la la la la la

My cherie amour lovely as a summer day
My cherie amour distant as the Milky Way
My cherie amour pretty little one that I adore
You're the only girl my heart beats for
How I wish that you were mine

In a cafe or sometimes on a crowded street
I've been near you but you never notice me
Oh cherie amour, won't you tell me how could you ignore
Back behind this little smile I wore
How I wished that you were mine

My cherie amour...
My cherie amour...

Maybe some day you'll see my face among the crowd
Maybe some day you'll share your little distant cloud
Oh cherie amour, pretty little one that I adore
You're the only girl my heart beats for
How I wish that you were mine

La la la la la la, la la la la la la la
