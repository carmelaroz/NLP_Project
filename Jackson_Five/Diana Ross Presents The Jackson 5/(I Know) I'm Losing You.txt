Ooh, your love is fadin', I can feel it fadin'
Girl, it's fadin' away from me
'Cause your touch, your touch has gone cold
As if someone else controls your very soul
I've fooled myself long as I can
And I can feel the presence of another man

Girl, when you speak my name, it's just not the same
Ooh, little girl, I'm losing you
It's in the air
It's everywhere
Ooh, baby, I'm losing you

When I look into your eyes
A reflection of a face I see
I'm hurt, downhearted and worried, girl
'Cause that face doesn't belong to me

It's all over your face
Someone's taken my place
Ooh, little girl, I'm losing you
It's hard to hide, emptiness you feel inside
Ooh, little girl, I'm losing you
You might also likeI can tell when we kiss, from the tenderness I've missed
Ah, baby, I'm losing you
I can feel it in my bones, any day you've been gone
Ooh, baby, I'm losing you
Ah, baby, what happened to the love we shared?
Ooh, baby, I'm losing you
I don't wanna lose you, girl; no baby...Embed
