Can you remember (Can you remember)
When we were babies (Babies)
We were always together
When we were in kindergarten (Kindergarten)

But now that you are grown
So girl you left me all alone
And you know I'll never find
No one to call my own
So girl, I love you (I love you)
Don't you know I love you (Don't you know I love you)
(I sure do, like for you)
Like for you (To remember if you can)
Hey, can you remember
(The time we had and the time we shared)
And the time we shared
(Sitting together in the grass)
In the grass, yeah

[Chorus: Michael + (Jackson 5)]
Can you remember (Can you remember)
When we were babies (Babies)
We were always together
And our love had no end (Had no end)
The sunny skies are blue
So girl, you know that I love you
And I'll always promise you
That this is what I'll do
So girl, I love you (I love you), I love you
Don't you know I love you (Don't you know I love you)
(I sure do, like for you)
Like for you (To remember if you can)
Hey, can you remember
(The time we had and the time we shared)
And the time we shared
(Sitting together in the grass)
Can you remember (I sure do, like for you)
Like for you (To remember if you can)
The time we had (The time we had)
And the time we shared (And the time we shared)
(Sitting together in the grass)
We're sitting in the grass, playing in the grass...Embed
