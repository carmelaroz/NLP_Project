Ah, listen to me, baby
Musical chairs, you see, my dear, ain't ever been my thing
Shuffleboard to me, you see, it just ain't the same
Well, tic-tac-toe has got to go
It truly has become a bore
Checkers games, I've lost my last
And I don't wanna lose no more

[Pre-Chorus: MIchael + Jackson 5]
Now, you can keep on playing hide and seek
And things like blind man’s bluff
But tricks are made for kids, baby
But the name of the game is love, oh

E-ne-me-ne-mi-ne-moe, the choice is yours to pull
Do you wanna keep on playing games
Or take this heart in full?
E-ne-me-ne-mi-ne-moe, the choice is yours to pull
Do you wanna keep on playing games
Or take this heart in full?

Now I believe in lovin’ hard
Don't care about games or money
I believe in being love rich
So I've never been love poor, honey
Playing the field behind my back
And to my face saying that you're true
That's the game foolish kids
Baby, not for me and you

So, don't keep your feelings hid
If you want me, tell me so
Can't you see tricks are made for kids
And these kids have got to go, oh

E-ne-me-ne-mi-ne-moe, the choice is yours to pull
Do you wanna keep on playing games
Or take this heart in full?
E-ne-me-ne-mi-ne-moe, the choice is yours to pull
Do you wanna keep on playing games
Or take this heart in full?

[Michael]
Oh, ooh yeah, na na na na, yeah, ooh ooh

[Jermaine + (Jackson 5)]
So, come on, honey, come kiss me and dream
I'm not make-believe (I'm the real thing)
I've got all the riches, baby
And I'm here to please

[Michael]
So, stop your fooling around
Push has come to shove
Throwing out the games of yesterday
Now the name of the game is love, oh
E-ne-me-ne-mi-ne-moe, the choice is yours to pull
Do you wanna keep on playing games
Or take this heart in full?
E-ne-me-ne-mi-ne-moe, the choice is yours to pull
Do you wanna keep on playing games
Or take this heart in full?
E-ne-me-ne-mi-ne-moe, the choice is yours to pull
Do you wanna keep on playing games
Or take this heart in full?
E-ne-me-ne-mi-ne-moe, the choice is yours to pull
Do you wanna keep on playing games
Or take this heart in full?Embed
