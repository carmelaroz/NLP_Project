Lookin' through the window
Lookin' through the window
Ah, ooh, lookin' through the window
Look, look, lookin' through the window, ooh-ah
Lookin' through the window

Lookin' through the window
The window to your heart
Oh, baby, yeah
I can see it's cloudy
The rain's about to start

Lookin' through the window
(Lookin' through the window)
It seems I caused your fears
Yeah, yeah, yeah
And that little doubt, girl
(And that little doubt, girl)
And now it's bringing tears
(And it's bringing tears)

[Chorus: Michael Jackson + Jackson 5]
(Remember)
Just remember whatever makes you feel that way
Don't you worry 'cause I'm gonna stay
Right by your side (By your side)
To keep on lookin' through the window
Lookin' in your eyes
Lookin', lookin' in your eyes, eyes, eyes
Lookin', lookin' in your eyes, eyes, eyes
Lookin' through the window
(Lookin' through the window)
Seems like the only way, yeah
(Ah, ah, ah)
I can know your feelings
If you still love me today

[Chorus: Michael Jackson + Jackson 5]
(Remember)
Just remember whatever makes you feel that way
Don't you worry 'cause I'm gonna stay
Right by your side (By your side)
To keep on lookin' through the window
Lookin' in your eyes
Lookin', lookin' in your eyes, eyes, eyes
Lookin', lookin' in your eyes, eyes, eyes

[Outro: Jackson 5, Michael Jackson]
Lookin' through the window
The window to your heart
Ah-ah, ah-ah...
Lookin' through the window
The window to your heart
Za ta ta da da da da ah, da da da da da da ah ah
(Oh, baby!)
Za ta ta da da da da ah, da da da da da da ah ah1Embed
