Ain't nothing like the real thing, baby
Ain't nothing like the real thing, no, no
Ain't nothing like the real thing, baby
(Ain't nothing)
Ain't nothing like the real thing

Ooh, I've got your picture
Hanging on the wall
But it can't see or come to me
When I call your name
(When I call your name)
I realize it's just a picture in a frame
I read your letters
When you're not near
But they don't move me
And they don't groove me
Like when I hear
(When I hear your voice)
Your sweet voice
Whispering in my ear
(In my ear)

[Jermaine]
No other sound is quite the same
As your name
(Quite the same as your name)
Your touch can do half this much
To make me feel better
(So let's stay together)

Ooh, I got memories to look back on
Though they help when you're gone
I'm well aware
(I'm well aware)
Nothing can take the place of your being there
(Being there)

Ain't nothing like the real thing, baby
(Ain't nothing)
Ain't nothing like the real thing
Ooh, baby
Ain't nothing like the real thing, baby
(Ain't nothing)
Ain't nothing like the real thing
Ooh, baby
Ain't nothing like the real thing, baby
Ain't nothing like the real thing, yeah yeah...Embed
