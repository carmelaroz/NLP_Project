Don't let your baby catch you
Don't let your baby catch you
Don't let your baby catch you
Fooling around
You just might lose the best thing you ever found
Don't let your baby catch you
Fooling around

Oh, the nights are lonely, twice as cold
Without my baby's hand to hold
My happiness is fading away (fading, it's fading away)
Just like a thief, I tried to steal a kiss
From another pretty miss
My baby was the price that I paid

[Pre-Chorus: Michael + (Jackson 5)]
Now listen, fellas
(Think twice)
Think twice if you have cheating on your mind
(Watch your step)
Remember, the punishment will fit your crime

[Chorus: Michael + Jackson 5]
Don't let your baby catch you
Don't let your baby catch you
Don't let your baby catch you
Fooling around
You just might lose the best thing you ever found
Don't let your baby catch you
Fooling around
Oh, I hope that now you let me be
Do right not wrong in full indeed
I'm gonna crawl back all the way on my knees
And if that's no use I'd get to move
And settle down and come to her
Oh, before I even say please
If I get one more chance
My life would be as good as new
And I would not forget the days
The sun would not shine through

[Chorus: Michael]
Don't let your baby catch you
Don't let your baby catch you
Don't let your baby catch you
Fooling around
Hey, hey, oh no
Take me back, take me back, take me back, 'maine

[Jermaine]
Oh, don't let her, your baby catch you
You might lose the best thing that you ever found
Tell about it, Mike
[Michael]
If you're crazy about your baby
And she's crazy about you
Just think of what you'd do to her
If she was untrue

[Chorus: Michael + (Jackson 5)]
Don't let your baby catch you (Don't)
Don't let your baby catch you (Say don't)
Don't let your baby catch you
Hey, hey, all right
Don't let your baby catch you
Fooling around
You just might lose the best thing you ever found
Don't let your baby catch you
Fooling around

Hey, hey, don't let her, don't let her, don't let her
Stop, stop, stop

Don't let your baby catch you
Fooling around
You just might lose the best thing that you ever found
Don't let your baby catch you
Fooling around
Hey, hey...Embed
