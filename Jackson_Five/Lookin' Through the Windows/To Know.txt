To know of life (To know of life)
Is to know what I'm living for
Touch my hand
And, baby, I'm yours
To know of love (To know of love)
Is to know that I live for you
To be in love
Is to be there with you

(Every day)
Every day means so much to me (Much to me)
But it all depends on you
Don't you know (Don't you know), oh baby
We were meant to be (Meant to be)
Oh, and life for me begins and ends with you

To know you're mine (To know you're mine)
Is to know how it used to be
Yesterday (Yesterday) is all I can see
That's how I know
Life can be beautiful
But it all depends on you
Now that you're gone, baby
You might also like[Break]
(Since you've been gone)
Just not the same, baby
Since you've been gone
Just not the same, baby

To know of us
Is what I'm still living for (Living for you)
But it all depends on you
Baby, it all depends on you

(Baby, come home)
To know happiness
(Home)
Is to know you're here in my arms
(Baby, come home)
Let me know, let me know, let me know
(Home)
What it is to live again
(Baby, come home)
Hoo hoo
(Home)
(Baby, come home)
Oooh oooh ooh ooh
(Baby, come home)Embed
