Who's the one that loves you
The special one who needs you
You made the odds a million to me
No one else can love you
Nobody else can need you
No more than the one whose heart you won't believe

[Chorus: Michael + Jackson 5]
So if I have to move a mountain
Simply to prove that you're my love (My love)
That you're my love, baby (My only love)
I'll do it (Do it), yes, I'd do it
To show I love you

In your eyes, I see no faith
There's an absence of trust in your embrace
But why would I pretend to give
Just to take from the person for whom I live

[Pre-Chorus: Jackson 5 + Michael]
I told you that I love you
Especially I need you
You're one love in a million was made from the stars
And maybe you'd believe me
Then maybe you would need me
But maybe may not ever convince your stubborn heart
You might also like[Chorus: Michael + Jackson 5]
So if I have to move a mountain
Simply to prove that you're my love (My love)
You're my love, baby (My only love)
I'd do it (Do it), I'll do it, yes I'll do it for you
And if I have to stop a river
To make you believe that I'm the one (The one)
That special one you need (That special one)
I'd do it (Do it), yes, I'd do it (To show I love you)

[Bridge: Jackson 5]
Pins and needles sticking in my heart
We're so close, but still so far apart
What to do, what to do to make you need my love too

[Chorus: Michael + Jackson 5]
Oh, do I have to move a mountain
Simply to prove that you're my love (My love)
That you're my love, baby (My only love)
I'd do it (Do it), I'll do it, yes I'll do it for you
And if I have to stop a river
To make you believe that I'm the one (The one)
That special one you need (That special one)
I'd do it (Do it), yes, I'd do it (To show I love you)
And if I have to move a mountain
Simply to prove that you're my love (My love)
That you're my love, baby (My only love)
I'd do it (Do it), I'll do it, yes, I'll do it for you...Embed
