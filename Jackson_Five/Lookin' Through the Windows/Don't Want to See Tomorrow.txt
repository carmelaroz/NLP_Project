No quiero mirar mañana!
Don't wanna see... (No no no no no no no no)
Tomorrow, no no no, no no no
Don't wanna see... (No no no no no no no no)

Love has brought us to a fork in the road
Giving us a choice of two ways to go
My hope has always been to stay with you
But you like to leave me so all alone, oh

Don't wanna see tomorrow without you, girl
How can you say it has to be this way?
Don't wanna see tomorrow without you, girl
When our love was so strong just yesterday

A little at a time, you gained control
Ruling my heart and mind
And my very soul
But even if I knew what was to come
I'd gladly bare the pain
And love you just the same
Don't wanna see tomorrow without you, girl
How can you say it has to be this way?
Don't wanna see tomorrow without you, girl
When our love was so strong just yesterday
Yah!

[Jackson 5 + Michael]
Don't wanna see tomorrow
Don't wanna see tomorrow
No quiero mirar mañana!
Don't wanna see tomorrow, oh!

[Jermaine]
Somebody can you wake me
I must be dreaming
This just can't be for real
Must be mistaken
I can't believe you'd go after all this time
But if it's really true
I think I'll just lose my mind

Don't wanna see tomorrow without you, girl
How can you say it has to be this way?
Don't wanna see tomorrow without you, girl
When our love was so strong just yesterday
(No no no no no no no no) No no no no no no no no
Don't wanna see tomorrow without you, girl
How can you say it has to be this way?Embed
