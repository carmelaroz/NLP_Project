If you want it, you got it
I can only give you love
I can only give you love

Oh, Jimmy had a knack for talent
From being a baseball star
It makes you proud to work past it
'Cause it breaks all the other girls heart
Well, Billy had long black curly hair
And captain of the football team
While guys like me stood on the side
And watched the young girls scream

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh girl, I can only give you love
I've made no claim to fame, you won't know my name
Oh baby, I can only give you love
Girl, if it's love that you need
Come along here with me

If you want it, you got it
I can only give you love
I can only give you love
If it's love that you need
I got what you need
Come and get it
Come and get it
Come and get it
Come and get it
Come and get it
Woo!
Now Bobby was a little rich kid
Who lived at the foot of the hill
The first kid in the neighborhood
To have an automobile
Well, If I took you to the movies
We'd have to walk the block to the bus
Well, if you went with him
You could already be there eating popcorn and stuff

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh girl, I can only give you love
I've made no claim to fame, you won't know my name
Oh baby, I can only give you love
Girl, if it's love that you need
Come along here with me

If you want love girl
I got all the love you need
I got what you need
I can only give you love
I can only give you love
If you want love, girl
I got all the love you need
I got what you need
The love that you need
Come on here to me
Oh girl, I can only give you love
I've made no claim to fame, you won't know my name
Oh baby, I can only give you love
Girl, if it's love that you need
Come along here with me...Embed
